# Rust Guessing Game
This project is a simple command-line guessing game written in Rust. The program randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100. The player is prompted to guess the number, and after each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. The project demonstrates basic Rust concepts such as input/output, random number generation, error handling, and control flow.
